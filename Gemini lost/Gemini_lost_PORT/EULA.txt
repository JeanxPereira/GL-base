For optional updates and promotional upgrades You will be asked if You want the update or upgrade prior to transmission of game information to PlayFirst; for critical updates a notification will appear in the game window.  Through DRM, PlayFirst may disallow or disable access to the Software if PlayFirst has reason to believe it is being used in violation of these terms or when the term of this Agreement has ended.
